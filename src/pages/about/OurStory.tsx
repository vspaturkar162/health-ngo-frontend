        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        HealthForAll was founded with a simple yet powerful belief —
        that access to good health, safety, and dignity should not be
        determined by where a person is born or the resources they have.
        Our journey began when a group of healthcare professionals,
        social workers, and community volunteers came together after
        witnessing preventable health challenges faced daily by women
        and children in underserved urban communities.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        What inspired us was not just the scale of the problems, but the
        strength and resilience of the communities themselves. Mothers
        walking long distances for basic care, adolescents navigating
        health challenges without guidance, and frontline workers doing
        their best with limited resources showed us that meaningful
        change was possible — if communities were supported, listened
        to, and empowered.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        From small health camps and awareness sessions, our work has
        grown into structured programmes focused on preventive
        healthcare, nutrition, protection, research, and community
        leadership. We work closely with local partners, public health
        systems, and grassroots organisations to ensure our
        interventions are culturally sensitive, evidence-based, and
        sustainable.
      </p>

      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
        Our goal is to build healthier and safer communities by
        strengthening systems and supporting individuals — especially
        women, children, and adolescents — to make informed choices
        about their health and well-being. We believe lasting impact
        comes not from short-term solutions, but from long-term
        partnerships and shared responsibility.
      </p>
      <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
        This journey would not be possible without the trust of the
        communities we serve, the dedication of our field teams, and the
        support of our partners, donors, researchers, and volunteers.
        Together, we continue to work towards a future where everyone
        has the opportunity to live a healthy, dignified life.
